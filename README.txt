Polynomial Regression

----DESCRIPTION----

This program implements polynomial regression using gradient descent.
It will generate a 1st order, 2nd order, 4th order, and 7th order
polynomial for 3 sets of synthetic data. The sets are randomly sampled
to generate trainging and testing data so that the accuracy of the
models can be checked. Once the program has finished running it 
outputs graphs of the models with the dataas well as a console output of
the equations with their error.
